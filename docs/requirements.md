# Requirements for Login POC

## Problem Statement
The user requires a basic proof-of-concept login system to demonstrate the ability to authenticate a single predefined user.

## Functional Requirements
1.  The system SHALL present a login interface (e.g., username and password fields).
2.  The system SHALL allow a specific, predefined username and password combination to successfully log in.

## Constraints
There are no specified technical constraints, tech stack limitations, or development timeline constraints beyond the scope of a basic POC. The system is intended to support only one particular user for demonstration purposes.
